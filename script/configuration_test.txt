# This file stores the essential information that are required to run the pipeline via command line mode.
# 1. NGS data: 28 42 library (The order must match the order in 5, the input library is a must, and must be put at the last). Data can be retrieved from NCBI SRR ID or local storage, see a and b below. If both provided, the local copy will be used.
#  a. NCBI: SRR IDs separated by single space
#  b. Local: local raw read files with full path separated by single space
# 2. WT sequence: fasta file containing the reference sequence
# 3. Amplicon range: enclosed in parenthesis for each amplicon location
# 4. Mutation site in WT coordination: enclosed in parenthesis for each amplicon
# 5. Experiment conditions: 28 42 lib
